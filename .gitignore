# To ignore any directories named DirectoryA 
# in any depth use ** before DirectoryA
# Do not forget the last /, 
# Otherwise it will ignore all files named DirectoryA, rather than directories
## **/DirectoryA/
# This would ignore 
# DirectoryA/
# DirectoryB/DirectoryA/ 
# DirectoryC/DirectoryB/DirectoryA/
# It would not ignore a file named DirectoryA, at any level

# To ignore any directory named DirectoryB within a 
# directory named DirectoryA with any number of 
# directories in between, use ** between the directories
## DirectoryA/**/DirectoryB/
# This would ignore 
# DirectoryA/DirectoryB/ 
# DirectoryA/DirectoryQ/DirectoryB/ 
# DirectoryA/DirectoryQ/DirectoryW/DirectoryB/
